Building a 8 bit processor from scratch using logisim

I'm building an 8-bit microprocessor from scratch using Logisim. This project involves designing all fundamental logic gates, counters, and control units, creating the architecture entirely from the ground up. I'm also developing a basic instruction set and writing programs to test the processor's functionality. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how microprocessors work, from the combinational and sequential logic design to the execution of low-level instructions. This project showcases my skills in digital design, logic circuits, and hardware programming, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
